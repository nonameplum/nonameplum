## Hi there üëã, I‚Äôm ≈Åukasz ≈öliwi≈Ñski

I'm a seasoned software developer and currently focused on mobile development - iOS in particular, BLE integrations, and IoT working at üî¥ [Intent](https://withintent.com). My professional interests include clean code, application architectures, TDD, and building engaging user interfaces. I enjoy solving complex problems, and continuously improving my skills.
Before focusing on iOS development, I worked as a Full Stack Developer and have experience in Delphi.
I am also passionate about home automation and working with ESP32 devices, developing IoT solutions.
